					<h2>Long story</h2>
					<p>
					Hey there.I’m Ashtine! I'm originally from North Carolina, but I now call ATL home working as a QA Analyst at Mailchimp. I went to school at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC where I earned my BS in Communications, Public Relations and a Minor in Marketing. After graduating, I moved to ATL to work for a staffing firm. I quickly discovered it was not for me. I decided to enroll at General Assembly in a Front-end web development course. I was working full-time at the staffing firm while taking part time classes. Upon finishing the class, my teacher, who was also my mentor at General Assembly, helped connect me with Calendly where I got my first QA Analyst role. After working there for almost a year, I had the opportunity to work with Mailchimp, I couldn’t refuse. I started at Mailchimp February of 2018, and have loved every second of it!  I’ve worked on the Audience Management team and I’m currently on the Content Management System team.
