				<h1>Who am I?</h1>
				<p>
				This is information about me in here. I plan on having some really cool premium content. But I don't have it right now. Until then this will have to do because I just need some text on the page to see what the heck is going on my page.

			<div class="work-content">
				<h1 id="work-link">What have I done?</h1>
				<p>
				This information is going to be about work things that I do. Maybe things I'm good at, have done, or am learning. Ultimately, this is just placeholder text I will swap out but trying to get a general vision for how blocks of content will look on my page. This is rambling but its getting the job done.
